ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project is a School Chatbot built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach.
It combines LangChain, OpenRouter (GPT-3.5), and a MySQL database to allow users to ask natural language questions and get live answers from structured school data.

The chatbot runs inside a clean, interactive Streamlit web UI, making it suitable for real-world usage or academic submission.
